    "### Problem 2: Polynomial Regression (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that linear regression refers to fitting data to a model in which the weights appear linearly. But, the model itself need not use linear functions. The Gaussian RBFs we used were an example of that. Another very common choice is that of a polynomial. Let's code two cases in which the number of weights is and is not the same as the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to model our data with a polynomial. The data you are given is:\n",
    "$$x = [-2, -0.5, 0, 1] ,$$\n",
    "$$y = [0, 0.9375, 1, 3] .$$\n",
    "Because you have four data points, you are tempted to use a model with four parameters, such as:\n",
    "$$y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2 + w_3x^3 .$$\n",
    "But, you are also worried that the data may be noisy so you **also** want to fit it to only three weights. You decide that the $x^3$ term could cause large excursions that might follow the noise, so your second model is:\n",
    "$$y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only libraries from `linalg`, fit the data to both models. Plot the data and the two resulting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, the coding for this is trivial - the hard part is setting up the vectors and matrices. Slow down and be sure you understand what you are doing: this will help you set up the problem so that it is very easy. I'll give you a hint:\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\\\y_4\\end{bmatrix}}_{4\\times 1} = \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\0.09375\\\\1\\\\3\\end{bmatrix}}_{4\\times 1} =\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 4 & 8 \\\\ 1 & -0.5 & 0.25 & 0.125 \\\\\\vdots  \\end{bmatrix}}_{4\\times 4}\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} w_0\\\\w_1\\\\w_2\\\\w_3\\end{bmatrix}}_{4\\times 1}.$$\n",
    "It is crucial that you know where this came from!! Explain in a markdown cell where I got these numbers from.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then use Python to get the weight vector ${\\bf w}$, which allows you to plot the resulting polynomial. In one case you will need to use the pseudoinverse, [the `pinv` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.pinv.html), or in [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.pinv.html#scipy.linalg.pinv), because you have more data points than weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write your code in a general way, it is easy to implement the third model:\n",
    "$$y = w_0 + w_1x.$$\n",
    "Do that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of machine learning, we would need to figure out which of these three models is the \"best\", a process called \"_model selection_\". We won't worry about it now, but I wanted you to at least be aware of the idea. A second idea I'll introduce here is \"_regularization_\", since it is connected. Regularization is penalizing weights that cause large excursions; here, we are doing this by hand by dropping the higher-order terms (e.g., setting $w_3=0$), thereby prohibiting predictions with large excursions.  There are very powerful techniques for automating this. There is a lot to learn from this problem other than just setting up regression problems and inverting a matrix! ðŸ¤“ In a markdown cell, comment on which model you think is best based on your plot(s) and explain your reasons. (If you take a machine learning course, you will learn powerful mathematical methods to make this judgement.)\n"

    "\n",
    "I mentioned in class that we will mostly rely on Python libraries for performing linear algebra operations. Why not, isn't that why they were developed?!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also good practice to know how to do these by yourself for the simplest cases. This allows you to explore ideas without a computer and build your intuition for what the libraries are doing. We'll learn here how to invert a $2\\times 2$ matrix by hand. Being able to do this by hand also gives you a test case to ensure you are using the Python libraries correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Make a $2\\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}$ using a NumPy array (you might want to try several choices); if you don't know about these already, NumPy has [some nice functionality for creating arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.creation.html), which can be matrices, of various types.\n",
    "2. Find the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of your matrix, using:\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{det}(A) = ad - cb.$$\n",
    "Do this by hand, not with a library.\n",
    "3. Form the inverse $A^{-1}$ with\n",
    "$$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{det}(A)}\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "Show all of your steps using $\\LaTeX$ in a markdown cell.\n",
    "4. Now that you have $A^{-1}$, use the rules of matrix multiplication to find the product $A^{-1}A$. Show your steps.\n",
    "5. Vary the matrix $A$ and comment on anything interesting you see. For example, what would $A$ look like if its determinant were $0$? For example, make a matrix for which $b=2a$ and $d = 2c$. What does this case correspond to?"
